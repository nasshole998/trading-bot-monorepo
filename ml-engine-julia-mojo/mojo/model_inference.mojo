# Conceptual Mojo code for model inference.
# NOTE: Mojo syntax and features are subject to change.
# This demonstrates the *idea* of a high-performance inference function
# callable from Julia via C FFI.

from sys.ffi import CInt, CFloat64Ptr  # Assuming FFI types exist

# Define the model structure (e.g., weights, biases loaded from file)
# This would likely involve loading parameters during initialization.
# For simplicity, let's assume fixed parameters here.

    var bias: Float64

        self.weights = StaticTuple[Float64, 3](0.5, -0.2, 0.1)
        self.bias = 0.05

        # Apply activation function if needed (e.g., sigmoid)
        # result = 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-result))
        return result

# Global model instance (or load dynamically)
let model = SimpleLinearModel()

# Use @export decorator and specify the C name

**Disclaimer:** This Mojo code is highly conceptual and based on potential future syntax and FFI capabilities. The actual implementation will depend heavily on the state of Mojo when developed
